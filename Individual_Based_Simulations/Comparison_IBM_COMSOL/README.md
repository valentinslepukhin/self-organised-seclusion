Files here contain the code used to generate the data for Fig. 10, as well as the code to generate the Figure itself.

"Small_cells/" contains the code to run the simulations (the parameter "diam" sets the diameter of the cells), the outputted data, as well as the code to generate Fig.10.
"Big_cells/" the outputted data for big cells. There is a copy of this outputted data in "Small_cells/" used for plotting.
